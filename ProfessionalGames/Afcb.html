    <div class="textBlock">
        I was the main developer on this project from the beginning until its current state. The most notworthy contributions i made to the project included the implementation of global and timed leaderboards, interfacing with an online CMS to allow for dynamic content updates, and the development of a robust scoring and reward system to enhance player engagement. Additionally, I optimized the game's performance for web deployment, ensuring smooth gameplay across various devices and browsers.

    <div class="textBlock">
        Drift racer is a fast paced racing game focused on high speeds and drifting mechanics. Players can choose from a variety of cars, and a variety of tracks, each with their own unique challenges and layouts. The game is focused on being arcade oriented with each track designed to take no longer than 1 minute to complete. The game boasts a vibrant cel-shaded art style with bright colours, an effective use of shaders, and a low poly art style for greater contrast.

    <div class="sectionTitle">WHY DRIFT RACER EXISTS</div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        Drift racer was created as a part of my university coursework, specifically for a module focused on producing software within a team, and pitching said software to investors. The game was developed over a period of 6 weeks, with a team of 4 people including myself. While the main objective of the assignment was simply to create and present a presentation, we decided to go the extra mile and produce a polished game that could be added to our portfolios.

    <div class="sectionTitle">MY CONTRIBUTIONS</div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        I worked as the project lead and primary developer on Drift Racer. Within my group i was the only person with any experience developing games and therfore acted as a teacher to my team members. I was responsible for creating the core drive mechanics including the drifting system, car physics, and track design. Additionally i handled the art direction ensuring a coheasive visual style accross the game. I also managed the project timeline, delegated tasks to team members, and ensured effective communication within the team to meet deadlines and deliver a polished final product.

    <div class="sectionTitle">MY PROUDEST ADDITIONS</div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        As the main 3d artist on the project, I'm most proud of my shader graph work, alongside my map design and modelling. The shader graph work involved creating a lava shader that effectively simulated the look of molten lava, alongside this the overall game design was something i took great pride in, ensuring each track was fun, engaging, and flowed smoothly for players.

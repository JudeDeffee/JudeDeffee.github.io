    <div class="sectionTitle">ABOUT DRIFT RACER</div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        Drift racer is a fast paced racing game focused on high speeds and drifting mechanics. Players can choose from a variety of cars, and a variety of tracks, each with their own unique challenges and layouts. The game is focused on being arcade oriented with each track designed to take no longer than 1 minute to complete. The game boasts a vibrant cel-shaded art style with bright colours, an effective use of shaders, and a low poly art style for greater contrast.

    <div class="sectionTitle">WHY DRIFT RACER EXISTS</div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        I worked as the project lead and primary developer on Drift Racer. Within my group i was the only person with any experience developing games and therfore acted as a teacher to my team members. I was responsible for creating the core drive mechanics including the drifting system, car physics, and track design. Additionally i handled the art direction ensuring a coheasive visual style accross the game. I also managed the project timeline, delegated tasks to team members, and ensured effective communication within the team to meet deadlines and deliver a polished final product.

    <div class="sectionTitle">MY PROUDEST ADDITIONS</div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        One of my proudest additions to Volcano Island was the implementation of a mesh combining system, which significantly improved the game's performance on mobile devices. By reducing the number of draw calls, I was able to enhance frame rates and overall gameplay smoothness.
